      <h2> About Me</h2>
      <p> Hi, I'm Denzel Lee and welcome to Lee-way. I started during photography in an intro to Photography class,
        from then I started to really like it. I began taking photos for many of the student organizations events
         at my school which allowed me to gain a ton
        of experience
      </p>
